Description: Don't call update-mime-database during install.
 Upstream has the XDG MIME database snippets in its CMakeLists.txt,
 which leads to an update-mime-database call during "make install".
 .
 As we only need the MIME file and trigger the update-mime-database
 during package installation, we can remove this snippet and thus the
 B-D on shared-mime-database.
