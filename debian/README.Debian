kvirc for Debian
================

    A word on upgrading from KVIrc 3.x to KVIrc 4.x
    ***********************************************
    The deault configuration directory of KVIrc 3.x is <file://$HOME/.kvirc>.
    It might happen on the first startup of KVIrc 4, that you're asked where to
    store your configuration. In this case you can safely select the old
    configurtion directory to use your old settings. Any warnings, that this is
    not a KVIrc dirctory can be ignored. No dataloss has been reported so far.
    If you want to be on the safe side: make a backup.


    Embedded Perl
    *************
    The embedded Perl interpreter works again and uses PERL_SYS_INIT3(). It was
    briefly tested with the following example, you can test it in the Script
    Tester:
        perl.begin
            KVIrc::echo("Hello world\n");
        perl.end
